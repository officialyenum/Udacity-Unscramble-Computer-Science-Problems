run time analysis (Worst Case Big-O Notation) of your solution

TASK 0 has a runtime of O(1) as it is not dependent on the input
TASK 1 has a runtime of O(2n) as it is dependent on texts and calls list (n + n)
TASK 2 has a runtime of O(n) as it is dependent on calls list (n)
TASK 3 has a runtime of O(n log n) as it is dependent on calls list input, and uses sort to breakdown and rearange the final output in lexographical order
TASK 4 has a runtime of O(3n log n) as it is dependent on one texts list and 2 calls list input traversing through the input array three times (n + n + n), and uses sort to breakdown and rearange the final output in lexographical order
